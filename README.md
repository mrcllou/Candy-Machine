# Candy-Machine-Java

🍬 Candy Machine (Java)
A Candy Machine program built using Java in jGRASP.<br/>
This program simulates a vending machine where users can:<br/>

- Select a candy item<br/>
- Insert money<br/>
- Calculate the remaining balance<br/>
- Receive change if needed

## 🛠 Using: 

- Scanner Console
- If - else if - else statement
- Basic arithmetic calculations like:
```bash
   double change = (money - cost);
```

## ▶️ How it works: 

The user chooses between 5 sections of candy.<br/> 
Then the user inserts the money that they have.<br/> 
If the user has the perfect amount, nothing is returned,<br/> 
If they insert more, the user takes the change,<br/> 
and if the user inserts less money,<br/> 
The program will say: 
```bash
System.out.println("You're broke. Take your " + money + " and go elsewhere"); 
```


## 📖 This is a homework:
/!\ This is a Java program I wrote for a class assignment. /!\
